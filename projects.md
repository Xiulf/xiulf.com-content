## [pixel-sort](https://github.com/xiulf/pixel-sort)
A pixel sorter written in [Rust][ps.1]. Pixel sorting is a method of image distortion
which takes a range of pixels and sorts them based on one of it's properties such as red, green, blue, hue, etc.
This pixel sorter also allows sorting along a sine wave for some interesting effects.

## [Shade](https://github.com/Xiulf/shade)
A mostly functional programming language inspired by [Purescript][shade.1].
The compiler itself is heavily inspired by [rust-analyzer][shade.2] and [mun][shade.3].

## [Lowlang](https://github.com/Xiulf/lowlang)
A low level programming language and intermediate representation similar to [SIL][ll.1].
The goal is to provide an easy way for higher level compilers such as [shade][ll.2] to compile generic code without monomorphization.
