# Hi I'm Fluix

I'm a 21 year old IT student, studying at [InHolland][inholland]. I love programming, mostly in the [Rust][rust] programming language. I'm also really into functional programming and try to use it wherever possible. Besides programming I also really enjoy making digital [art](/art). I'm also the founder of the small record label [Cyduck][cyduck], since then ownership of the label has been transferred to Dylan (SCTRS) but I am still involved as a regular staff member.
